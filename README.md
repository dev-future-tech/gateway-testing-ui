# Gateway Testing UI

This application is designed to test out how Spring Cloud Gateway works. There have been some strange goings on and tyhis project will cover different scnenarios to determine how it works and how to approach the gateway when:

* Security is required
* CORS is required
* Different types of filters are used

The premise is that we integrate this UI with spring gateway to simulate production scenarios and prove out how to approach the models while also exploring other options (e.g. AWS API Gateway, WAFs, etc)
